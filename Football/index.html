    <p>A football team is a group of players selected to play together in the various team sports known as football.
        Such teams
        could be selected to play in a match against an opposing team, to represent a football club, group, state or
        nation, an
        all-star team or even selected as a hypothetical team (such as a dream team or team of the century) and never
        play an
        actual match.

        The difference between a football team and a football club is incorporation, a football club is an entity which
        is
        formed and governed by a committee and has members which may consist of supporters in addition to players. The
        benefit
        of club formation is that it gives teams access to additional volunteer or paid support staff, facilities and
        equipment.</p>
