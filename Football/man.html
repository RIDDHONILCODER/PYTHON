        <p>Manchester United Football Club, commonly referred to as Man United (often stylised as Man Utd) or simply
            United, is a
            professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England. They compete in the Premier
            League, the
            top tier of English football. Nicknamed the Red Devils, they were founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club
            in 1878, but
            changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After a spell playing in Clayton, Manchester, the club
            moved to their
            current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.</p>
