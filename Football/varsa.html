        On his visit to the city in 1862, Hans Christian Andersen remarked that Barcelona was the “Paris of Spain.” The
        city is
        indeed a major cultural centre with a remarkable history. It abounds with archives, libraries, museums, and
        buildings of
        interest, featuring superb examples of Modernist and Art Nouveau decor and architecture. Since the late 1970s,
        with the
        official recognition of the Catalan language and the granting of significant levels of regional self-government,
        cultural life has been revitalized, bringing with it a new awareness of the depth and variety of Catalan
        culture. This
        vitality combines with the striking physical setting of Barcelona—between scenic mountains and the Mediterranean
        Sea,
        with a benign climate that fosters street life—and its significance as an economic power and a major port to
        create a
        city of infinite variety. Area city, 38 square miles (98 square km); metropolitan area, 1,249 square miles
        (3,235 square
        km). Pop. (2011) 1,611,013; (2018 est.) 1,620,343.
