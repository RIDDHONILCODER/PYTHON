            Real Madrid has won more Spanish top-division (La Liga) championships (36) than any other Spanish side. The
            club
            has
            also won the Copa del Rey, the main Spanish cup competition, 20 times and the Supercopa de España (Spanish
            Super
            Cup) 13
            times. It won UEFA Cup twice, in 1985 and 1986.

            Real’s local competition is Atlético Madrid, but the club’s biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. The
            tension
            between
            the football clubs from Spain’s two biggest cities was amplified by a struggle between the teams in the
            1950s to
            sign Di
            Stéfano, who reneged on a proposed deal with Barcelona to sign with Madrid, helping Real become a football
            power
            in the
            1950s and ’60s. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”) and are
            watched
            throughout Spain, in large part because the two sides symbolize for many the ongoing political and cultural
            difficulties
            between Castilian (Real) and Catalonian (Barcelona) Spain.
