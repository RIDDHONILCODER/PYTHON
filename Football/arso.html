            The club was founded in 1886 and took the name Royal Arsenal after its first game, combining the moniker of
            the Royal
            Oak pub, where the team members met, with that of their workplace, the Arsenal munitions factory in
            Woolwich. The name
            was changed to Woolwich Arsenal in 1891, and Woolwich was dropped from the name after the 1912–13 season,
            when the team
            moved its home stadium to the Highbury section of the London borough of Islington. The club played at
            Arsenal Stadium
            (commonly referred to as “Highbury”) until 2006, when it relocated to a new, 60,000-seat stadium in
            Islington’s Holloway
            district.

            Arsenal has a long-standing rivalry with another North London club, Tottenham Hotspur, against whom it plays
            the “North
            London derby” match nearly every year. When the Football League resumed play in 1919 after World War I,
            Arsenal—which
            had finished fifth in the Second Division before the war—was controversially promoted to the First Division
            over
            higher-placing Tottenham after Arsenal’s chairman argued that his club deserved promotion because of its
            longer history,
            further spurring the rivalry between the two teams.
